# README
This repo contains code for the purecode assignment.
More details to be added later.

Task 1: Download the dataset D1, D2 and D3. Each dataset contains 300 (Input: Image, Output: Text) pair samples. Scan the datasets and give a short description of each dataset. 
 
 
Task 2: Train any neural network of your choice (one for each dataset). Provide comparative details on three datasets?, Possibly write a test code to infer the model that helps us to understand the model efficiency. 
 
 
Deliverables: 

•	A GitHub Repo with all the code used to train and evaluate the models

•	Readme file with following details: 

•	How you split the data into training, validation and test set 

•	Details of model architecture chosen and why you chose the model? 

•	Complete details on how to set up the training environment and all package dependencies. 

•	Steps to train the model. 

•	Steps to evaluate the model on the test set and get accuracy.
